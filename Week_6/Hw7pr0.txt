I think Machine Learning/Deep Learning is overtouted at the moment and has a long way to go to deliver on some of the
promise’s supporters have claimed. Since deep learning is supervised and relies on pattern recognition like a child or
a normal person time and experience are important which makes be think that the tech hype cycle is a good way of
thinking about ML/DL, however the idea that it is an inevitability is a bridge too far for me. I was just recently on a
trip to Silicon Valley were I got to meet some great people from a lot of amazing companies but what I found interesting
was that at most of them the sales and marketing teams were by far the largest in the company and I think this is why
we see technology move through a cycle from inflated expectations to disillusionment and the technology that really works
and adds value eventually gets used and is productive. Until then there is a lot of marketing buzz word bullshit and
consulting hype that personally drives me crazy. Similar to ML/DL/AI is Blockchain which I have been interested in for
a while and during the peak of the Bitcoin mania I went to a conference where in the first hour the word “Blockchain”
was mentioned over 100 times without anyone every mentioning an actual use case or why they would need a Blockchain, I
felt sick with the space and to my disgust some of the companies there went on to raise tens of millions of dollars for
their startups. If ML/DL lives up to the hype it will take time and lots of hard work, and honestly the best thing that
could probably happen is to slide down the hype cycle so the marketers and shills go away, and the engineers can get
that work done.
