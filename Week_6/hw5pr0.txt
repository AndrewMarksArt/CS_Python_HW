Like the author I believe there are some serious issues with Isaac Asimov’s three laws and the example in the reading of
what constitutes harm is a great way demonstrate the inadequacies. However, I feel Etzioni’s proposed principals are naïve,
particularly with the rule of obeying human laws, which human laws? What happens when laws in different countries are in
conflict? What happens when laws are on the books but never prosecuted or conflicting regulations? The note that we don’t
want to allow China to take the lead in developing the technology but if these rules were enacted it would create
incentives for countries to deregulate or create legal systems that allow more to try and win the race for developing
AI if it is this powerful technology we think it could be in a strange race to the bottom. The other rules seem ok in
theory but in practice how would it be implemented and what penalties would there be if broken, without strong enough
enforcement then this is all just nice theory and useless in the real world. Along the “promise of AI” continuum I
find my self closer to Musk as a pessimist not because I’m afraid of the technology but because I have very little
faith in humanity.
