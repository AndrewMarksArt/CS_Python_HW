This article was very interesting and really made me think about how I perceive the world around me. I'm fairly comfortable
with geo based directions and have given many directions to friends using North, East, West and South but to have no
understanding or way to communicate behind, in front of, to the left/right is somewhat mind blowing. The ability of these
communities and the individuals in there to be able to pick out N, E, W and S even when blind folded or in a dark room
is incredible. I do wonder how there languages emerged and still exist since it seems like it would be hugely advantageous
to combine both. I would love to learn more abut these fascinating communities, they must have been amazing traders or explorers
since navigation is so important but then how did they not run into other communities where ego centric directions dominate
and how could that not have had an impact on them?
