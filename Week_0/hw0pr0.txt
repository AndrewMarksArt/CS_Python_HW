This article was very interesting and really made me think about how I perceive the world around me. I'm fairly comfortable
with geo based directions and have given many directions to friends using North, East, West and South but to have no
understanding or way to communicate behind, in front of, to the left/right is somewhat mind blowing. The ability of these
communities and the individuals in there to be able to pick out N, E, W and S even when blind folded or in a dark room
is incredible. I do wonder how there languages emerged and still exist since it seems like it would be hugely advantageous
to combine both. I would love to learn more abut these fascinating communities, they must have been amazing traders or explorers
since navigation is so important but then how did they not run into other communities where ego centric directions dominate
and how could that not have had an impact on them?

I have definitely run into language problems when talking with people from other countries, most recently in my classes at
CGU. I had a group project last semester with someone from China, another student from France, and another from Russia. I was
the only native English speaker and become the defacto group editor. It was amazing to see how often they struggled to understand
certain words or phrases since they didn't have a word or way to say those phrases in their native languages and how they
could get close in terms of grammar but needed lots of help to clarify what they really meant to avoid any confusion. At times
it felt like I would have to completely re-write whole sections as they would make no sense and was really time consuming
as it would mean meeting and talking with them in person to figure out what they really meant and then translating.
