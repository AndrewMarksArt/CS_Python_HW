I fully agree that algorithms can be problematic, they are made by humans and are an extension of the
programmers logic and biases. All of us are biased to a certain extent and have been shaped by our experiences
and it is unlikely that those biases and experiences wont effect the algorithms being writen. But Users and
advertisers that uses these algorithms can be just as big of a problem as the programmers, users can game the
system like when users on twitter trolled Microsoft's AI chat bot into parroting racist neo-nazi talking points
in a matter of hours. For advertisers they might have internal data showing that men or another category click
through and convert at higher rates, the business I ran for my family was originally targeted at elderly or
people recovering from injury but we found new mothers in there 20s and 30s converted and spent significantly
more money on our products so our advertising changed, so while our product could be used by anyone we targeted
women in that age range more. In the article the ads being served to men more than women could be due to internal
metrics or by racist companies and the best remedy seems to be more competition where bad / racist decisions
would get punished but we also might need to accept that sometimes the data might be correct but not pc.
