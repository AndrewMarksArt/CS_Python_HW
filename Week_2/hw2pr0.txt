For me the most interesting idea was Watson's ability to parse and understand language
which on Jeopardy is really impressive. I think most of us have used Google translate
and laughed at the result showing just how difficult it can be for a computer to
understand human languages and why so many companies are racing to perfect this technology.
In terms of Jeopardy Watson didn't need to translate and know multiple languages but did
have to be able to understand an answer and come up with a question which is very difficult.
I would love to see how Watson would do in predicting prices at Sotheby's or Christies
art auctions. My masters degree is in Arts Business and results from art auctions can be
very interesting, the market is unregulated, you have unique objects with unique histories,
very small samples and human emotion that all contribute to wild results. A project I have
been working on is trying to predict prices with the goal of starting an investment group
that buys and eventually flips contemporary art but the unpredictable nature of the market
makes it very risky. Lastly the way Watson seems to think is by looking for connections
between things and then ranking the probability or likelihood that is is correct which is
similar to humans but only in an encyclopedia way, so much more of communication and human
thinking is so much more. Specifically when it come to communication what we say or write
is only a tiny part of what we are communicating, the context, our body language, sarcasim,
etc. can all be misleading and contradicting which seems like it would result in lower
probability understanding by Watson.
